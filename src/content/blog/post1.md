Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that allows multiple parties to maintain a shared and tamper-resistant record of transactions or information. It was originally developed as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its potential applications extend far beyond digital currencies.

## Key Features of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization:** Blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers, known as nodes, where each node has a copy of the entire blockchain. This eliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary to control and verify transactions.

2. **Security:** Transactions recorded on the blockchain are secured through cryptographic techniques. Each transaction is linked to the previous one using a hash function, creating a chain of blocks. Once a block is added to the chain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or delete the information stored within it.

3. **Transparency:** The blockchain ledger is transparent and publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view the transaction history. However, the identities of the participants involved in the transactions can be pseudonymous, providing a certain level of privacy.

4. **Immutability:** Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it becomes virtually immutable. The distributed nature of the blockchain network ensures that multiple copies of the ledger exist, making it highly resistant to tampering or manipulation.
